<div align="center"><h1>Darkstack - a collection of dark themes for VSCode</h1></div>
These are a part of the themes I have made for myself. I created Darkstack because I wanted to share the ones I like the most with others.  

**Table of content:**  
  - [Installing and choosing a theme](#item-one) 
  - [Examples](#item-two) 


<a id="item-one" />

## Installing and Choosing a Theme
1. Search and install "Darkstack" in the VSCode extensions tab.
2. Open the command tab (``Ctrl+Shift+P``)  -> enter ``Preferences: Color Theme`` -> select desired theme.
2.1 If you have a lot of themes installed type ``Darkstack`` to filter for Darkstack themes only.
